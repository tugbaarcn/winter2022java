     1. Write a class with the name Circle. The class needs one field (instance variable)

    The class needs to have one constructor with parameter radius of type double, and
    it needs to initialize the fields.
    In case the radius parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the radius field value to 0.
    Write the following methods (instance methods):
    * Method named getRadius without any parameters, it needs to return the value of radius field.
    * Method named getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated area (radius * radius * PI).
    For PI use Math.PI constant.
